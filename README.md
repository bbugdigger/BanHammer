# BanHammer

The rise of cheating in the gaming industry is hurting both players and developers—especially smaller studios that can’t afford expensive anti-cheat solutions. Seeing my favorite childhood games lose their reputation to cheaters inspired me to create this open-source project.  

### **Current Goals:**  
- **Kernel-level detection** (for advanced protection)  
- **External cheat detection** (Overlays)  
- **Internal cheat detection** (DLL injection, hooks)  

This is just the beginning—I plan to expand features gradually with community support. If you're a developer, contributor, or just passionate about fair play, let’s work together to make gaming cheat-free!

### **Features (Planned/WIP)**  
| Component          | Status       | Description                          |  
|--------------------|-------------|--------------------------------------|  
| Kernel Driver      | *Planned*   | Ring-0 protection for tamper-proof detection |  
| External Detection | *In Progress* | Scans for cheat processes/tools      |  
| Internal Detection | *In Progress*   | Detects injected DLLs, hooks, etc.   |
